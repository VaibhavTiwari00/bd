                            A thorough quality check in the food processing industry augments the safety quotient beyond comparison. All our units are laced with in-house QA/QC labs ensuring quality checks at 4 levels:<br><br>
                            <b> 1. Entry point for raw materials</b><br>
                            Best products originate from the best raw materials. We check the incoming materials for their moisture content, grain size, nutritional value, foreign contamination, sensory testing, and palatability.<br><br>
                            <b>2. Byproduct quality and quantity</b><br>
                            Our processing process aims at lesser waste generation to provide greater value to the main product.<br><br>
                            <b>3. Final product</b><br>
                            The final product undergoes deep quality checks like water absorption, mixing, behavior, starch gelatinization, shelf life, and sensory evaluation before packaging.<br><br>
                            <b>4. Safe storage at warehouses</b><br>

                            To ensure safe storage at the warehouse, we carry out periodical quality checks for moisture and oxygen content, and any microbial activity.

                        <p>
                            Careful packaging of food materials is as important as their production. Packaging needs to be safe and sustainable. Our in-house packaging unit including the packing material production unit and printing house guarantees minimal quality and quantity loss and ensures timely deliverables.<br>
